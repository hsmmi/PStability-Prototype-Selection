Implementation on my thesis "Prototype Selection in Neighborhood-based Algorithms by Efficiently Computing p-stability"

Prototype selection algorithms:

Prototype selection is a technique used to reduce the number of instances in a dataset by selecting a subset of instances that are representative of the dataset. This technique is used to reduce the computational cost of algorithms that use the dataset as input. In this thesis, we focus on prototype selection in neighborhood-based algorithms. These algorithms use the dataset to compute the similarity between instances and make predictions based on the similarity. The computational cost of these algorithms is proportional to the number of instances in the dataset. By selecting a subset of instances, we can reduce the computational cost of these algorithms without significantly affecting their performance.

The implemented prototype selection algorithms are:
- CNN
- DROP3
- ICF
- LDIS
- LSBo
- LSSm
- HMNEI
- RIS1 - RIS3
- NNGIR
